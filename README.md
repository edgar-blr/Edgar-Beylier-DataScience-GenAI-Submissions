# Data Science & Generative AI – Corporate Finance Applications

This repository contains selected notebooks developed as part of the *Data Science & Generative AI* module.  
The work focuses on how data science and artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to **corporate finance decision support**, rather than on pure algorithmic performance.

The repository is structured around three core themes that directly support the analytical discussion developed in the written assignment.

## Repository Structure

### 1) Data-Driven Forecasting & Scenario Analysis
**Folder:** `1) Data-Driven Forecasting & Scenario Analysis`

This section focuses on predictive analytics as a **decision-support tool** rather than a purely statistical exercise.  
The notebooks illustrate how historical financial data can be explored, modelled, and interpreted to support forecasting and scenario analysis.

**Notebooks:**
- `2_05_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`  
  Exploratory analysis of financial data, focusing on distributions, correlations, and data quality issues.
- `4_01_Linear_Regression_(statistics_vs_machine_learning).ipynb`  
  Comparison between statistical and machine learning approaches to regression, highlighting differences in interpretation, validation, and predictive focus.

### 2) Company Screening & Segmentation
**Folder:** `2) Company Screening & Segmentation`

This section examines how machine learning models can support **company screening and peer group construction**, a critical task in corporate finance (e.g. valuation and benchmarking).

**Notebooks:**
- `4_01_Decision_Trees.ipynb`  
  Illustrates rule-based segmentation and how firms can be split into homogeneous groups based on observable characteristics.
- `5_01_Random_Forest_and_GBDT.ipynb`  
  Extends segmentation using ensemble methods to capture more complex interactions and improve stability.

### 3) Text-Based Decision Support
**Folder:** `3) Text-Based Decision Support`

This section explores how **unstructured textual data** can be transformed into decision-relevant signals using modern deep learning approaches.

**Notebooks:**
- `6_03_ML_in_practice.ipynb`  
  Discusses practical challenges such as overfitting, validation, and generalisation.
- `7_X_illustrated_self_attention_.ipynb`  
  Conceptual introduction to the attention mechanism underlying transformer models.
- `8_01_Transformer_Backbone_and_Finetuning.ipynb`  
  Application of a pre-trained transformer (BERT) to text classification, comparing frozen embeddings and fine-tuning approaches.
